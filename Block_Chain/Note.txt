 ## Hash Funtion ##

 Hash funtion is an algorithm that converts a string of
 arbitrary length into a string of bits

Hashes are used in computer science for speed up certain algorithm
Cryptograaphic hash is also called non-malleable.
Means two very similar input should not produce similar output.

hash funtion that we are going to use here is SHA-256

## Code_Detailing ##

##def __init__(self, mystring):
        self.string = mystring
The above code is a constructor generally used to initiating an object.
The job is to assign value to the data members of the class when an object
of the class is created. The __init__() method is called the constructor and
always invoked when the object is created.

Syntax:
def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor

Types of constructors:

There are two types of constructors
1) Default Constructor :Dosent accept any arguments
2)Parameterized Constructor:Contains arguments

(self) -> points to the object created by the class

##def __repr__(self):
        return self.string

The constructor do not return any data

##Error Example
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: __init__() should return None, not 'str'


__repr__() use to represent the class object as a string
__repr__() is called by a built-in function called repr()

##pass

pass is a null statement
the interpreter does not ignore pass statement, but nothing happen
and the statement result into no operation. This statement is useful
we don't want to write the implementation of a function but you want to
implement in the future.
